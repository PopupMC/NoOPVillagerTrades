## No OP Villager Trades

A security plugin that carefully watches, modifies, and removes villager trades
that could cause economy problems. Created after the unlimited money exploit
discovered by xd_autoyt and knightly.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
